In Solo, players must rely on their own skills and decision-making to outlast 99 other players. Duos and Squads, on the other hand, require excellent communication to coordinate tactics, support each other, and win. \n\nOne of the most critical aspects of communication in Fortnite is callouts. Callouts are brief and concise statements made by players to their team that lets them know what’s happening or where an enemy or objective is located. Common callouts include “Enemy spotted!”, “Need backup!”, “Building southeast!” and “Resuscitating teammate!” These can be learned from some of the many Fortnite content creators on Youtube and other platforms. Having a designated IGL, or in-game leader, can be extremely helpful in coordinating communication and strategy. \n\nIn terms of teamwork, it's essential to work together to survive and win. This may mean reviving downed teammates, sharing materials, distributing weapons and ammo among team members, and prioritizing communication-based objectives. It's important to make sure everyone is comfortable with their role - for example, one player being designated as the dedicated sniper - and then create a plan based on that. By working together and communication through callouts, Fortnite players can achieve victory royales and become successful players. \n\nQuiz:\n1. What are callouts in Fortnite?\n2.

In this lesson, we will be discussing Double and Triple Ramp Rushing, 90° Degree Turns, and Wall Replace Techniques. Double and triple ramp rushing require you to quickly build two to three ramps side by side to gain high ground advantage over your opponent. 90° degree turns allow you to quickly turn your ramp 90° while building, giving you a wider span to run across. Finally, the wall replace technique is where you quickly destroy a wall in order to place your own wall and gain control of a specific area. \n\nFor example, when using the double ramp rushing technique, you will want to start by placing a ramp and wall. Then quickly place another ramp next to that one, and finish with walls on either side. This will give you a wide base to run on, and allow you to gain high ground quickly. For the 90° degree turn, while building a ramp, quickly press the turn button to snap the ramp in the desired direction. Finally, for the wall replace technique, quickly switch to building your own wall and aim for the weak spots in an opponent's wall. When their wall breaks, quickly place your own wall in its place to deny them control of the area.\n\nPractice Problem: \nYou are in a build battle and your opponent has the high ground. How can you quickly gain the advantage by using double ramp rushing? \n\nSolution to Problem: \nPlace one ramp to start, and then quickly place two more ramps side by side. Finish by placing walls on either side. This will give you a wide base to run on and the high ground advantage. \n\nSummary:\nIn this lesson, we learned about advanced building techniques such as double and triple ramp rushing, 90° degree turns, and wall replace techniques. These skills are essential for gaining the high ground advantage and controlling the battlefield. Remember to practice these skills to become proficient at them."

                    "info": "Lesson Content:\nScavenging and Looting Tips and Tricks: Hot Drops, Llama Hunting and Loot Paths.\n\nScavenging and looting are essential in Fortnite since players need to find weapons and supplies to stay alive. Thus, this lesson will focus on three specific techniques that will help you become more efficient and effective at scavenging and looting: Hot Drops, Llama Hunting and Loot Paths.\n\nFirstly, hot drops are locations where multiple players land in the early game to try and get the best weapons and loot available. Some popular hot drop locations include Tilted Towers, Retail Row, and Salty Springs. Landing in a hot drop can be risky since many other players are likely to land there, but it is also a great way to get the best gear and start the game on the right foot.\n\nSecondly, Llamas are large supply drops that can be found scattered across the map. They contain a massive amount of resources and useful items such as rare weapons, ammo, and building materials. Finding them can be tricky since Llamas are often hidden away in less traveled areas, but the rewards are usually worth the effort.\n\nLastly, loot paths refer to the routes taken by players to quickly find and collect loot. Knowing the best loot paths in each location can save valuable time, so it's important to learn the layout of each area. Some loot paths to consider include starting on the outskirts of a location and then working your way in, or sprinting through low-risk areas to avoid engaging in combat until you have the appropriate gear.\n\nBy mastering these techniques, you will become a more efficient looter and be better equipped to handle whatever challenges come your way.\n\nQuiz:\n\n1. What are hot drops?\n\n2. What are Llamas?\n\n3. Why is it important to know loot paths?\n\nAnswers:\n\n1. Hot drops are locations where multiple players land in the early game to try and get the best weapons and loot available.\n\n2. Llamas are large supply drops that contain a massive amount of resources and useful items such as rare weapons, ammo, and building materials.\n\n3. Knowing loot paths is important to save valuable time and collect loot more efficiently."

In this lesson, we will learn how to select the proper weapon and utilize it effectively in combat. We will also learn about positioning and covering, which will help us outmaneuver our opponents.\n\nFirstly, we need to understand the concept of weapon rarity. In Fortnite, weapons are differentiated by their rarity, from Common (grey) to Legendary (orange). Generally speaking, the higher the rarity of a weapon, the stronger it is. However, it is important to remember that a skilled player with a lower rarity weapon can still beat a less skilled player with a higher rarity weapon. This means that we need to choose our weapon based on the situation at hand.\n\nSecondly, positioning and covering play a crucial role in winning battles. When engaging in combat, we want to make sure that we are in a position of advantage. This could mean having high ground or cover. High ground allows us to have a better view of the situation and makes it easier for us to aim and shoot accurately. Cover provides protection from incoming fire, giving us time to heal and reload. We need to be aware of our surroundings and use them to our advantage.\n\nQuiz:\n1. What is weapon rarity?\n2. Why is positioning important in Fortnite?\n\nAnswers:\n1. Weapon rarity is how Fortnite classifies weapons based on strength, from Common (grey) to Legendary (orange).\n2. Positioning is important in Fortnite because it can provide an advantage in combat, such as having high ground or cover."

                    "info": "Lesson Content: \n\nEnd Game Approaches: \nIn Fortnite Battle Royale, the game gets more intense as the players' numbers decrease. This means that the end game requires different strategies than the earlier stages. Here are three key things you need to know about End Game Approaches: rotations, zone awareness, and high ground stealing. \n\nRotations: As the storm closes, it's important to plan your rotation. Rotations allow you to move with the storm and gain better positioning for the final fights. Make sure to have a good awareness of the terrain which can help you understand where you should rotate and where you should avoid. \n\nZone Awareness: Keeping an eye on the circle can be vital in the end game. Knowing how much time you have to rotate and where to go can help you stay one step ahead of other players. Always keep in mind the circle is not static and it will close faster and deal more damage the closer you get to late stage circles. \n\nHigh Ground Stealing: The high ground is an important factor in all stages of Fortnite play. In the end game, players often build high structures to gain an advantage over their enemies. By constructing ramps, cones, or walls, you can quickly gain the high ground over other players and eliminate them before they can even react. \n\nQuiz:\n1. What is the difference in End Game strategies compared to earlier stages? \n2. Why is it important to have Zone Awareness in the end game? \n3. What is High Ground Stealing and how can you utilize it in the end game?\nAnswers:\n1. The end game needs different strategies due to the decrease in players and the higher intensity.\n2. Zone Awareness helps you to stay ahead of other players and to plan your rotations.\n3. High Ground Stealing is where you build and obtain the high ground to have an advantage over your enemies."
