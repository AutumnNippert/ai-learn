Addition is represented with the plus sign (+) and the numbers being added are called addends. \n\nTo perform addition with whole numbers, we simply add the digits in each place value column, starting from the right. If the sum of the digits in a column is greater than 9, we carry over the tens place to the next column to the left. \n\nFor example, to add 567 and 244, we first add 7 and 4 to get 11. We write down the 1 and carry over the 10 to the next column. Next, we add 1, 6 and 4 (the digits in the tens place) along with the carried over 10 to get 21. We then write down the 1 and carry over the 20 to the next column. Finally, we add 2, 5, and 2 (the digits in the hundreds place) along with the carried over 20 to get 29. The sum of 567 and 244 is 811. \n\nPractice problem: Add 789 and 245. \n\nSolution: We start by adding the ones place digits, 9 and 5, to get 14. We write down the 4 and carry over the 10 to the next column. Then we add 8, 4 and 2 (the digits in the tens place) along with the carried over 10 to get 24.

The plus sign (+) is used to represent addition.\n3. The digits being added are called addends.\n4. To add whole numbers with more than one digit, start adding the digits in the ones place, carry over any tens place digits that go beyond 9, and continue adding the digits in each place value column from right to left."

Subtraction is a fundamental arithmetic operation, and it is used to find the difference between two numbers. For example, if you have ten apples and you give three away, you are left with the difference of seven apples.\n\nTo perform subtraction with whole numbers, we begin by aligning the numbers vertically, so that the ones place is lined up with the ones place, the tens place with the tens place, and so on. Then we subtract each digit from right to left, borrowing if necessary. For example, if we have 359 - 124, we would line them up vertically like this:\n\n```\n  359\n- 124\n-----\n```\nStarting from the right, we first subtract 9 - 4, which gives us 5. Then we subtract 5 - 2, which gives us 3. Finally, we subtract 3 - 1, which gives us 2. So the difference between 359 and 124 is 235. \n\nPractice problem: Calculate 785 - 456.\n\nSolution: \n\n```\n  785\n- 456\n-----\n  329\n```\n\nThe difference between 785 and 456 is 329.\n\nSummary: In this lesson, we learned about subtraction, which is used to find the difference between two numbers. We also learned how to perform subtraction with whole numbers by aligning the numbers vertically and subtracting each digit from right to left, borrowing if necessary. With practice, subtraction can become quick and easy!\n\nQuiz:\n1. What is subtraction used for?\n2. What is the difference between 863 and 247?\n3.

Multiplication is the process of finding the total number of objects when we have a certain number of groups with the same number of objects in each group. The symbol for multiplication is X or *.\n\nExample: Suppose we have two groups of 3 apples. How many apples do we have in total? We can find the answer by multiplying the number of groups (2) by the number of objects in each group (3). So, 2 X 3 = 6 apples in total.\n\nLet's practice with a problem: If a carton has 5 eggs and there are 4 cartons, how many eggs are there in total?\n5 X 4 = [20 eggs in total]\n\nTo summarize, we learned that multiplication is the process of finding the total number of objects when we have a certain number of groups with the same number of objects in each group.

Division is the process of finding out how many times one number can go into another. For example, if we divide 10 by 2, we want to know how many times 2 can go into 10. The answer is 5, because 2 x 5 = 10.\n\nTo perform division with whole numbers, we use the division sign, which looks like ÷ or /, and the numerator and denominator. The numerator is the number being divided, and the denominator is the number it is being divided by. For example, in 10 ÷ 2, 10 is the numerator and 2 is the denominator.\n\nTo solve this division problem, we can use long division, which is a step-by-step method for dividing larger numbers. You start by dividing the first digit(s) of the numerator by the denominator, then multiply the denominator by the quotient to get the partial product. You subtract the partial product from the numerator to get the remainder, and bring down the next digit of the numerator to continue the process until there are no more digits left to bring down.\n\nExample:\nDivide 168 by 4 using long division.\n       _\n4 | 168\n       1\n       __\n        8\n        8\n        __\n        0\nAnswer: 168 ÷ 4 = 42\n\nQuiz:\n1.

An inequality can be represented using symbols such as \"<\" (less than), \">\" (greater than), \"<=\" (less than or equal to), \">=\" (greater than or equal to), and \"!=\" (not equal to). \n\nFor example, 5 > 3 means that 5 is greater than 3, and x <= 10 means that x is less than or equal to 10. Solving an inequality involves finding the values of the variable that make the inequality true. This is similar to solving an equation, but with an inequality, we have a range of possible values instead of just one value. \n\nTo solve a simple inequality, we can use inverse operations to isolate the variable on one side of the inequality symbol. As with equations, we must perform the same operation on both sides of the inequality to maintain balance. \n\nFor example, to solve the inequality 2x + 3 <= 9, we can subtract 3 from both sides to get 2x <= 6. Dividing both sides by 2 gives x <= 3, which means that any value of x less than or equal to 3 will make the inequality true. \n\nQuiz:\n1. Solve the inequality 4x + 7 > 19\n2.

Formulas are an essential tool in mathematics, science, engineering, and many other fields. Understanding how to use them is crucial to solving complex problems.\n\nTo understand formulas properly, we must first understand the basic elements that make up a formula: variables, constants, and arithmetic operations. Variables are symbols or letters that represent an unknown quantity, while constants are numerical values that do not change. Arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. \n\nOnce we understand these elements, we can begin to solve problems using formulas. We can substitute the known values into the equation, manipulate it as needed, and solve for the variable we are trying to find. For example, to calculate the area of a rectangle, we use the formula A=lw, where A represents area, l represents length, and w represents width.\n\nPractice problem: Find the area of a rectangle with a length of 5 cm and a width of 7 cm.\n\nSolution: \n    A = lw\n    A = 5 cm x 7 cm\n    A = 35 cm²\n\nIn summary, formulas are an essential tool for solving complex mathematical problems.
