While audio files consist of recorded sound or music, MIDI files contain musical information or data that can be played back by a synthesizer or digital instrument.\n\nOne of the main advantages of working with MIDI files in Reaper is that they offer a lot of flexibility for editing and manipulation. You can easily change the pitch, tempo, or even the instrumentation of a MIDI file. On the other hand, audio files may not offer the same level of flexibility, but they do offer a more authentic sound quality. \n\nFor example, if you want to change the piano sound in a MIDI recording, you can do it easily by using a software instrument. Whereas, if you want to change the sound of a recorded piano, you may have to record it again.\n\nBy grasping the difference between audio and MIDI files, you can better understand how they are used in Reaper. Whether you want to add effects, manipulate the sound, or create new compositions, understanding how to work with the files is essential. \n\nThat's all for this lesson. Stay tuned for more in-depth lessons on editing and processing audio and MIDI files in Reaper! \n\n[Image Reference: Audio vs. Midi - Audio and Midi Files] (https://images.app.goo.gl/wUtD13TsXgxiB9G3A)"

In this lesson, we will learn how to use these effects and plugins effectively.\n\nFirstly, when adding effects and plugins to an audio track, it\u2019s best to use them selectively. One common effect used in Reaper is the Reverb plugin. Reverb simulates the sound of a real environment. A short reverb on a vocal sounds like the performer is singing in a small room, whilst a long reverb sounds like the performer is singing in a cathedral. Experiment with different lengths for your reverb to see what works best for your audio track.\n\nSecondly, the EQ (Equalizer) plugin is a powerful tool that is essential for mixing and mastering audio. The EQ helps to regulate the level of various frequencies in an audio track. To use it, open an EQ plugin on an audio track and adjust the settings to your liking. Reducing the low-frequencies can help remove hums and \u2018booms,\u2019 whilst raising the high-frequencies can give the audio track a crisper sound.\n\nFinally, when using plugins in Reaper, you can adjust the level of the effect to your liking through the plugin\u2019s interface. Be sure to play around with the different options to achieve the desired effect on your audio track. \n\nQuiz:\n\n1. What is the Reverb plugin used for?\nA. To remove background noise \nB.
