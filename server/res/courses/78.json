Tough spots can come in various forms, such as bruises, scuffs, and blemishes, and they can be caused by multiple factors including insect damage, disease, or handling. \n\nIdentifying tough spots can be done by simply looking or feeling the apple. If there's a visible discoloured area or an indentation on the apple skin, it's highly likely that it's a tough spot, and in some cases, it can lead to decay if not removed. \n\nTo clean up tough spots, we'll need to have a sharp paring knife or a peeler since we don't want to remove unnecessary flesh. When it comes to shallow scuffs or blemishes, we can remove those with the tip of a paring knife by gently scraping the surface. If the tough spot is deeper and slightly darker, we can remove it more extensively using the peeler or paring knife. \n\nIn some cases, a small patch of tough skin may be difficult to remove, so we have to accept that not all tough spots will be completely eradicated. If removing the tough spot will consume a significant amount of pulp, it's best to just chop the bad parts off and use the rest. \n\nSummary: Identifying and cleaning up tough spots on the apple skin is an essential skill to avoid loss of apple taste and quality.

However, with the right techniques, you can peel apples quickly and efficiently, even with curly peels.\n\nExplanation of topic: \nCurly peels occur when the peeler doesn't initially catch the skin, and so the blade bites into the apple at an angle, cutting out small sections of the peel. The small sections of the peel curl up, causing the peel to detach, and the process repeats.\n\nMore in-depth information on topic:\nTo avoid this pattern, hold the apple as you would for a vertical peel. Start with the blade on the side of the apple, as opposed to the top, and apply pressure as you begin to move the blade down. Apply a gentle pressure to the apple and tilt the blade toward the apple slightly to ensure that it catches the peel. Keep the blade close to the curling sections, gently pulling it away as you peel.\n\nExample of topic if applicable: \nFor example, if you have an apple with a particularly curly area, you can work your way around it, peeling off the curlier parts first and then working your way towards the smoother areas. This way, you are less likely to accidentally cut into the apple fruit.\n\nScenario: \nYou're peeling an apple with a very curly section. You try to peel it, but the blade catches and the peel starts to curl up and detach from the apple. \n\nAction for scenario:\nTo peel this apple, you should gently pull the peeler blade away from the curling sections, while holding the apple firmly in your other hand. Apply a slight tilt to the blade towards the apple, so that it catches the peel. Gently work your way around the curly section, peeling off the curlier parts first and then the smoother areas.\n\nSummary of lesson: \nCurly peels can be a challenge when peeling apples, but with these techniques, you can peel apples quickly and efficiently, even with curly peels.\n\nQuiz: \n1.

Some of these qualities are related to the skin, which can be tough or thin, smooth or bumpy, and come in many different colors. Depending on the type of apple, different peeling techniques may be necessary to achieve optimal results.\n\nIn-depth info: For example, if you’re peeling a dense, hard apple like a Granny Smith, you may need a more substantial peeler to remove the thicker skin. Soft, thin-skinned apples like Golden Delicious or Red Delicious may only require a light touch with a more delicate peeler.\n\nScenario: Suppose you have a batch of Red Delicious apples to peel. You grab your standard peeler and start scraping away, but find that the skin is resistant to your efforts, leading to lost fruit and frustrating scraps. \n\nAction: What you should have done, is select a gentler peeler or use a technique that is less abrasive to the fruit, such as making a series of shallow scores along the circumference of the apple before peeling. This method allows the skin to loosen before peeling, resulting in less waste and more precise removal.\n\nSummary: In this lesson, we learned that not all apple varieties are created equal when it comes to peeling techniques.

Here's the lesson content:\n\nOverview:\nLearning how to peel an apple is an essential skill for anybody who loves the fruit. However, sometimes, peelers may break or cut irregularly. This can lead to wasted fruit and accidental injuries. In this lesson, we will go over how to troubleshoot common peeling problems like broken peels or excess waste.\n\nExplanation:\nThere are many different reasons why a peeler might break or leave excess waste on the apple. It could be due to blunt blades or not holding the apple securely. Identifying the source of the issue is the first step towards solving it.\n\nMore in-depth info:\nIf the peeler's blades aren't sharp, the peeler can break the peel instead of removing it.
