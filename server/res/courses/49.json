Jamestown, founded in 1607 was created by the Virginia Company of London, who hoped to make a profit from the natural resources found in the New World. Plymouth, founded by Pilgrims in 1620, was established to escape the religious persecution they faced in England. Lastly, New Amsterdam, which would later become known as New York, was founded in 1626 by the Dutch West India Company who hoped to use the colony as a trading post. \n\nEach colony faced unique issues, but all had to overcome harsh natural environments, conflicts with Native Americans, and struggles with disease. During your study of colonial America, it’s important to recognize the significant contributions each colony made to shaping America. For example: \n\n-The Jamestown colony -  introduced tobacco to the New World which became the major export, and established practises of representative government.\n-The Plymouth colony - established the American tradition of Thanksgiving and laid the foundation for religious freedom in America. \n-The New Amsterdam colony - helped establish America as a cultural melting pot by encouraging religious tolerance and open immigration policies. \n\nQuiz: \n1. Who established the Jamestown colony?\n2. What major crop grew in the Jamestown colony?\n\nAnswers: \n1. The Virginia Company of London\n2. Tobacco."

The colonists relied on farming and trading to sustain themselves. Farming included subsistence farming and cash crops such as tobacco, rice, and indigo. The most prominent form of trading involved the exchange of raw materials for finished goods with England. Religion played a critical role in colonial life. The colonists came to America to practice their religion freely. The Puritans and Pilgrims were among the first religious groups to arrive in America. They established their own communities and churches based on their beliefs. Education was a privilege for affluent colonists, as it was expensive and not easily accessible. Education was mostly private, and the literacy rate among the general population was low.\n\nExample: An example of a cash crop was tobacco. The Virginia Colony earned most of its income from tobacco sales. The colonists would use a barter system, exchanging tobacco for English fabrics, tools, and other goods. \n\nQuiz:\n1. What was the most prominent form of trading in colonial America?\n2. Who were the first religious groups to arrive in America?\n3. Was education easily accessible for colonists?\n4. Why was tobacco a significant cash crop in colonial America?\n\nAnswers:\n1. The exchange of raw materials for finished goods with England.\n2. The Puritans and Pilgrims.\n3.

Even though the British won the war, it was a costly victory, and many in the colonies were unhappy with the British government's attempts to pay for it. To cover the cost, Britain began imposing taxes on the colonists. The first tax was the Stamp Act of 1765, which required colonists to pay a tax on legal documents, newspapers, and other printed materials. The colonists were outraged and launched a campaign of protests and boycotts. In 1773, colonists in Boston staged the famous Boston Tea Party, dumping tea into the harbor to protest “taxation without representation.” This event led to increased tensions and eventually to the American Revolution.\n\nQuiz:\n1. What was the French and Indian War?\n2. What was the Stamp Act, and why were colonists so unhappy about it?\n3. What was the Boston Tea Party, and why did it happen?\n\nAnswers:\n1. The French and Indian War was a conflict between Britain and France in the American colonies.\n2. The Stamp Act was a tax on legal documents and other printed materials.

These laws enforced racial segregation and promoted discrimination against African Americans in public places such as schools, buses, and even restrooms. Legal segregation officially began in 1896 with the Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson which established the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, which allowed for the segregation of races as long as separate facilities were deemed equal in quality. \n\nAn example of Jim Crow laws includes the  segregation of schools where African American children were forced to attend inadequate, poorly funded segregated schools that lacked basic facilities like textbooks and classrooms. In contrast, whites had access to well-funded schools with better teachers, facilities, and textbooks. The legal doctrines also seeped into other areas, and bans on interracial marriage and brutal lynching of African Americans became all too common.  \n\nQuiz: \n1. When did legal segregation officially begin in the United States?\n2. What was the \"separate but equal\" doctrine?\n \nAnswers: \n1. In 1896 with Plessy v. Ferguson.\n2.
