These tiles are divided into three categories; honor tiles, flower tiles, and character suit tiles. There are four honor tiles (East, South, West, and North), eight flower tiles (two of each kind), and 36 character suit tiles (one to nine of each kind). \n\nTo set up the game, each player will need to draw 13 tiles from the wall created by shuffling and stacking the tiles together. The remaining tiles form the \"dead wall.\" Each player then arranges their tiles face up in front of them, forming a wall, and the game begins. The objective of the game is to complete a hand consisting of four sets and one pair. A set can be a sequence of three tiles in the same suit, or a triplet (three identical tiles) of any tile. The pair must also be the same tile.\n\n1. How many tiles are in a Mahjong set? \n- A Mahjong set has 144 tiles.\n\n2.

The game involves skill, strategy, and a bit of luck as players aim to create sets of tiles and win the highest points possible. The objective of the game is to score points by creating sets of tiles using a combination of chi (a set of three in sequence), pong (a set of three identical tiles), and kong (a set of four identical tiles). The winner is the person with the highest score at the end of the game.\n\nNow, let's get to the basic rules of the game. At the beginning of Mahjong, each player receives 13 tiles, and the game's wall has an additional 14 tiles. Players take turns drawing tiles from the wall and discarding one tile per turn. The first player to have a complete set of chi, pong, or kong plus a pair of identical tiles is considered the winner. It's important to note that some tiles have special roles in the game, such as the flower and season tiles, which grant bonus points to players who draw them or complete sets involving them.\n\nLet's test your understanding with a quick quiz:\n\nQ1. What's the objective of Mahjong?\nA1. To score points by creating sets of tiles using chi, pong, and kong.\n\nQ2. How many tiles does each player receive at the beginning of the game?\nA2. 13.\n\nQ3.

There are also various bonuses that can be added to your score, depending on how quickly you win and the specific tiles in your hand.\n\nHand Composition: Mahjong hands can be composed of sets of tiles, which can be either \"pungs\" (three of a kind) or \"chows\" (a run of three consecutive tiles of the same suit). A Mahjong hand must have four sets of tiles and a pair to win. It is important to understand the different combinations possible and to plan ahead to make the best possible hand.\n\nQuestions: \n1.

Safe discards refer to discarding tiles that opponents are unlikely to pick up. Players should always be mindful of the tiles they discard, as they could potentially lead to an opponent winning. By discarding safe tiles, players can decrease the chances of opponents winning and increase their own chances of completing a hand.\n\nTile blocking is another important technique in Mahjong. This involves strategically holding onto certain tiles that can prevent opponents from completing their hand. For example, if a player is holding onto the North Wind tile and opponents need it to complete a hand, they can block the tile to hinder their opponents\u2019 progress. This technique requires careful observation of the tiles discarded by opponents and predicting their potential hands.\n\nPractice these strategic moves to improve your Mahjong game and increase your chances of winning. Remember to pay attention to the tiles that are discarded and remain aware of the possibilities for potential hands. Keep practicing and honing your strategy to become a Mahjong expert! \n\nQuiz Questions:\n\n1.

A good strategy starts with having a general plan of what you want to achieve and how you want to achieve it. A game plan includes things such as knowing when to be aggressive or defensive, which combinations to collect, and which tiles to discard.\n\nHowever, even the best-laid plans may not succeed if you don't adapt to changing circumstances. Being flexible and responsive to changing game conditions can be the difference between winning and losing. For example, if an opponent is playing very defensively, you may need to change your strategy to become more aggressive to set up a winning hand. This includes identifying which tiles your opponents are discarding and what combinations are still available to you.\n\nIn summary, having a well-defined overall game plan and being able to adapt to changing circumstances are essential skills for winning at Mahjong. These skills take practice to develop, but with dedication and perseverance, you can become a master of the game."
