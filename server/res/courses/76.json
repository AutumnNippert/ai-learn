Tortillas have been a staple food in Mesoamerica for thousands of years, dating back to the Aztecs and Mayans. They were made from maize, also known as corn, which was a sacred crop to these cultures. Maize was believed to have been a gift from the gods and was considered a symbol of life and fertility.\n\nThe ancient Mesoamericans used various techniques to make their tortillas, including grinding the corn into masa, which was then shaped into a flat disc and cooked on a griddle. Tortillas were not only a food source but also had symbolic significance in religious and social practices. They were used in ceremonies as an offering to the gods, as well as in important life events such as weddings and funerals.\n\nAn example of the significance of tortillas in Mesoamerican cultures can be found in the story of the Aztec goddess, Xochiquetzal. It is said that Xochiquetzal was the goddess of fertility and beauty who was also associated with love and flowers. It was believed that she created the first tortilla and taught women how to make them. In honor of Xochiquetzal, women would often decorate their tortillas with flowers and other colorful designs.\n\nQuiz:\n\n1. What is maize also known as?\n2.

Initially, the colonizers found the concept of tortillas bizarre. However, they quickly saw the value in tortilla consumption, which was a source of protein, carbohydrates, and essential nutrients. The Spaniards also found the durability of tortillas appealing, as they could be conserved for days, which meant that they were perfect for long sea voyages.\n\nAs a result, the tortilla began to spread throughout the world. The Spanish introduced the tortilla to other European countries, such as France, where they adopted the dish alongside a myriad of other Mexican foods. Tortillas eventually reached the United States, where they became a ubiquitous staple in many households and restaurants across the country.\n\nOverall, the introduction of tortillas to European colonizers was a highly significant moment in culinary history. It led to the spread of this versatile food throughout the world and contributed to the multiculturalism of our culinary landscape.\n\nQuiz:\n1. Why did European colonizers initially find the concept of tortillas bizarre?\n2. What was one factor that made the Spaniards appreciate the value of tortilla consumption?\n3.

Their versatility is a defining characteristic of Mexican food; they can be used in dishes ranging from simple tacos to complex dishes like enchiladas and chilaquiles. Tortillas can be made from a variety of grains, including corn or wheat, and come in different shapes and sizes.\n\nThe use of tortillas in Mexican cuisine can be traced back to pre-Columbian times when indigenous people used them as a dietary staple. With the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, new ingredients were introduced, including wheat and meats like beef and pork. This led to the creation of new dishes like burritos and quesadillas that incorporated both flour and corn tortillas.\n\nThe versatility of tortillas extends beyond just their role in Mexican cuisine. They are also symbolic of cultural identity and community. Tortilla making is often a communal activity, with families coming together to create them by hand using traditional techniques that have been passed down for generations. The process of making tortillas is considered to be a bonding activity that reinforces cultural traditions and values.\n\nQuiz:\n1. What is a defining characteristic of Mexican food?\n2. How have tortillas evolved over time?\n \nAnswers:\n1. A defining characteristic of Mexican food is the versatility of tortillas.\n2.

                    "info": "In this lesson, we will be exploring the symbolism of tortillas in contemporary Mexican-American identity and politics. Tortillas are not just a food, they are also a symbol of cultural identity and resistance. People of Mexican descent who have immigrated to the United States have brought with them traditions, language, and food. The demand for tortillas has soared, and we see them being sold in mainstream supermarkets. Still, the cultural significance of the tortilla and the role it plays in Mexican-American culture has remained strong.\n\nOne example of the symbolism of tortillas is the use of the phrase \"tortilla curtain\". This concept comes from a novel by T.C. Boyle with the same name, which is a metaphor for the border that separates the United States from Mexico. The tortilla curtain represents the veil of ignorance that prevents people from understanding what happens on the other side. The metaphor has been used to describe the social, economic, and political barriers between Mexicans and Americans, and how they are often misunderstood.\n\nAnother example of the symbolism of tortillas is how they have become a symbol of resistance in contemporary Mexican-American politics. In 2012, protests erupted across Mexico when the government raised the price of corn, the main ingredient in tortillas. People took to the streets with signs that read \"No m√°s tortillas caras\" or \"No more expensive tortillas\". The protests brought attention to the government's neglect of indigenous and rural communities, who rely on corn and tortillas as a staple food. The symbolism of tortillas as a staple food and cultural symbol was used to express political unrest.\n\nQuiz:\n1. What is the \"tortilla curtain\" metaphor?\nAnswer: The \"tortilla curtain\" metaphor is a symbol for the border that separates the United States from Mexico.\n2. Why did protests erupt across Mexico in 2012?\nAnswer: Protests erupted across Mexico in 2012 when the government raised the price of corn, the main ingredient in tortillas."

In recent years, the popularity of Mexican cuisine has grown globally, leading to a high demand for tortillas. This has led to the growth of large-scale tortilla production factories and the use of genetically modified corn to increase production rates. [Source](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/03/01/517802522/how-mexicos-tortilla-crisis-still-hurts-the-poorest)\n\nMoreover, the rise of multinational fast food chains has also significantly impacted the tortilla industry. For example, Taco Bell was founded in the United States in 1962 and has since then expanded worldwide.

[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/01/dining/unwrapping-the-taco-bell-gordita.html)\n\nAnother impact of globalization on tortilla production is the use of wheat flour instead of corn to make tortillas. This change has led to the creation of hybrid tortillas like the \"flour tortilla.\" These tortillas are not traditionally used in Mexican cuisine but have become a popular option in many parts of the world.

Masa dough is an essential ingredient in traditional Mexican cuisine, as it is used in many dishes like tortillas, tamales, and pupusas. \n\nFirst, we will begin with preparing the dough. Masa dough is made from masa harina, which is a type of ground corn flour treated with lime. The masa harina is mixed with warm water until it becomes a pliable dough. It's important to let the dough rest for about 30 minutes before using it, so that it can fully hydrate and become easier to work with. \n\nNow, onto the cooking techniques. After the dough has rested, it's time to shape it into the desired form. For tortillas, the dough can either be shaped by hand or by using a tortilla press. Once the tortillas are shaped, they can be cooked on a hot, dry griddle or comal. It's important to not overcook the tortillas, or they will become hard and difficult to eat.\n\nIn summary, preparing and cooking masa dough requires attention to detail and some good old-fashioned elbow grease. By following these techniques, you'll be able to create delicious and authentic Mexican dishes right in your own kitchen. Quiz: 1. What is masa harina? 2.

One of the most common methods is the use of a tortilla press, which is a specialized tool used to flatten masa into thin, round discs. The press is made up of two flat plates that are pressed together to flatten the masa. Once the masa is flattened, it can be cooked on a hot surface, such as a griddle or skillet, until it is crisp and golden brown.\n\nAnother popular method for shaping tortillas is to use a rolling pin. To do this, the masa is placed between two sheets of plastic or parchment paper and rolled out to the desired thickness. The rolled out masa is then cut into rounds using a cookie cutter or a knife. The edges are then trimmed to create perfectly round tortillas. Once the tortillas are shaped, they are cooked on a hot surface until they are cooked through and lightly browned.\n\nOverall, there are many different methods for shaping and rolling tortillas, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Whether you prefer the convenience of a tortilla press or the versatility of a rolling pin, there is no shortage of ways to make these delicious and versatile flatbreads.\n\nQuiz:\n1.
