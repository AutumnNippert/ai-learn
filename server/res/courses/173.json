Most air fryers have a basket in which the food is placed and a heating element that heats up the air. As the air circulates, it cooks the food evenly and quickly.\nExamples: Commonly air-fried foods include chicken wings, fries, and vegetables.\nScenario: You have a craving for chicken wings, but want to make them a bit healthier. How can air frying help you achieve this?\nAction: Air frying chicken wings instead of deep-frying them will reduce the amount of oil and fat used in the cooking process.\nSummary: Air frying is a cooking method that uses hot air to fry food instead of oil. It is a healthier alternative to deep frying and creates crispy food with less fat."
