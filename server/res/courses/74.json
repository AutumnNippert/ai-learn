The external anatomy of the banana fruit is composed of several parts, including the stem, skin, flesh, and tip. The stem is the part of the banana that was once connected to the tree, and it is usually removed before consumption. The skin is the protective outer layer of the banana, and it is made up of several layers of cells. The flesh is the pulpy, juicy portion of the banana that we eat. The tip is the narrow, tapered end of the banana that is opposite to the stem.\n\nAn example of the external anatomy of a banana would be if you held the fruit in your hands and inspected its various parts. You would notice the stem at one end of the fruit, and the tapered tip at the opposite end. The skin of the banana would be thin and yellow, with small brown flecks indicating ripeness. Peeling the banana would reveal the juicy white flesh within.\n\nQuiz:\n1. What is the stem of a banana?\n2. What is the tip of a banana?\n3. What color is the skin of a ripe banana?\n\nAnswers:\n1. The stem is the part of the banana that was once connected to the tree.\n2. The tip is the narrow, tapered end of the banana that is opposite to the stem.\n3.

A banana peel is the outermost layer of a banana fruit, and its physical properties include thickness, texture, and flexibility. The thickness of the peel can vary depending on the age and ripeness of the banana, with older bananas having a thicker peel than younger ones. The texture of a banana peel is smooth and slightly waxy, which helps to protect the fruit inside from external damage.\n\nThe flexibility of the banana peel is an important characteristic that allows for efficient and safe peeling. When a banana peel is too rigid, it can be difficult to remove without bruising the fruit inside. However, when a peel is too flexible, it can be a sign that the banana is over-ripe and may not be safe to eat. Itâ€™s important to find the right balance between flexibility and rigidity when choosing a banana to eat or use in cooking.\n\nQuiz:\n1. What are the physical properties of a banana peel?\n2. Why is flexibility an important characteristic of a banana peel?\n3. How can you tell if a banana is over-ripe? \n\nAnswers:\n1. The physical properties of a banana peel include thickness, texture, and flexibility.\n2. Flexibility is an important characteristic of a banana peel because it allows for efficient and safe peeling.\n3. A banana may be over-ripe if its peel is too flexible and easily falls apart when touched. It may also have brown spots on the peel and a softer texture overall."

Banana peels may seem simple, but they actually have a complex structure that includes several layers. The outermost layer is the cuticle, which is a waxy layer that helps protect the flesh of the banana. Beneath the cuticle is the epidermis, which contains several different types of cells, including parenchyma cells, which are responsible for storing nutrients and water.\n\nBelow the epidermis lies the hypodermis, which provides support for the structure of the banana peel. This layer is made up of fibers called sclerenchyma cells, which give the peel its strength. The innermost layer of the banana peel is the phloem, which transports nutrients from the plant to the fruit.\n\nOne interesting fact about the microscopic structure of a banana peel is that it contains small pockets of gas that help the fruit to ripen. These pockets contain the gas ethylene, which triggers the ripening process. \n\nQuiz:\n1. What is the outermost layer of a banana peel called?\n2. What is the function of the hypodermis layer in a banana peel?\n3. What gas is found in small pockets within a banana peel that triggers the ripening process?\n\nAnswers:\n1. The outermost layer of a banana peel is called the cuticle.\n2. The hypodermis layer of a banana peel provides support for the structure of the peel.\n3.
