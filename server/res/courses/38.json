Unlike traditional linear development methods, Agile involves iterative and incremental cycles of development. This approach values customer satisfaction, working software, teamwork, and flexibility. It encourages frequent feedback and communication between customers, developers, and stakeholders.\n\nAn example of Agile Development is the Scrum framework. Scrum is a popular Agile methodology. It organizes the development process into short, repeatable sprints of work. Each sprint has a set goal, is timeboxed, and includes a sprint planning meeting, a daily stand-up, a sprint review, and a retrospective. During the sprint, the team works on tasks from the product backlog and collaborates with stakeholders to ensure the end product meets their needs.\n\nQuiz:\n1.

These included the inability for teams to adapt to changes, long development cycles, high costs, and a disconnection between developers and clients. In 2001, a group of 17 software developers met at a ski resort in Utah and came up with the Agile Manifesto, which is a set of principles for Agile Development.\n\nSome of the key figures who played a role in the development of the Agile methodology include Kent Beck, who created Extreme Programming (XP), and Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber, who co-created Scrum. Other methodologies such as Kanban and Lean software development were also influenced by the Agile Manifesto.\n\nThe Agile Manifesto emphasized the importance of individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change. As a result, Agile Development methodologies prioritized iterative development, regular feedback and communication, and flexibility.\n\nQuiz:\n1.

In this lesson, we will discuss the most popular Agile development frameworks, such as Scrum, Kanban, Lean and XP.\n\nScrum is an Agile framework that is similar to an iterative process in which a small team works to create a product increment. The Scrum process includes four key events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective. During a Sprint, the development team delivers a working increment of the product. Scrum typically relies on a team with a product owner who represents the stakeholders, Scrum Master who acts as a facilitator, and the development team.\n\nKanban is another Agile methodology that focuses on the flow of work. The process starts by visualizing every step of work to understand the current status and bottlenecks. With the help of limits, the team ensures that there is no overburdening of tasks. Kanban methodology is quite flexible and can be incorporated into any process to improve the flow of work.\n\nQuiz:\n1. What is Scrum?\n2. What are the key events of Scrum?\n3. What is Kanban?\n4.

Scrum is an Agile framework that is designed to help teams deliver high-quality products in a collaborative environment. Unlike traditional Waterfall methods, Scrum breaks down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable iterations which are known as \"Sprints\". During each Sprint, a cross-functional team works together to produce a working product increment that is potentially shippable. This agile development methodology is perfect for teams working on complex or rapidly evolving projects.\n\nScrum has three main roles: The Product Owner, Scrum Master, and the Development Team. The Product Owner is responsible for prioritizing tasks and ensuring that there is a clear direction for the team to work in. The Scrum Master is a facilitator who ensures that the Scrum process is adhered to and that the team is getting the support they need. The development team is responsible for doing the work and delivering the product increments.\n\nAn example of how Scrum works is a cross-functional team for a software company that is looking to release a new version of their program to users. The Product Owner, who is custodian for the new features, creates a prioritized backlog of tasks for the team. The Scrum Master makes sure everyone understands the process, and the team breaks the work down into two-week Sprints. Each Sprint involves planning, implementation, testing, and review. At the end of each Sprint, there is a potentially shippable increment of the product, and analysis and review of the Sprint occur. The product, therefore, gets time to be tested by the end-users before handing over the final product.\n\nQuiz:\n1. What is the Scrum Methodology?\n2. What are the three main roles in Scrum?\nAnswers:\n1. Scrum is an Agile framework that helps in delivering high-quality products in a collaborative environment.\n2.

Kanban is a Japanese term that means \"billboard,\" \"signboard,\" or \"visual board.\" In Kanban methodology, an object or card represents an individual work item or task to be accomplished. Visual boards, columns, and swim lanes are used to create a comprehensive workflow. The goal of Kanban is to improve efficiency and to eliminate wasted time or resources.\n\nAs an example, consider a software development team working on a new app. To use Kanban, they would need a board with columns that represent each stage of the development process (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Testing, Done). Each task would be represented by a card that could be moved along the board as it is completed. This allows the team to visualize the progress of the project and easily identify where they are spending too much time.\n\nTry your hand at Kanban by creating your own visual board. Create a board with columns labeled To Do, In Progress, Testing, and Done. Write down tasks on index cards or Post-It notes and move them along the board as you complete them. How does it feel to see your work laid out in front of you? Do you feel more in control of your productivity?"
