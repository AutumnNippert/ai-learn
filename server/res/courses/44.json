HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it is used to create and structure content on the web. To create an HTML document, we start with the doctype declaration, which tells the browser what version of HTML we are using. It looks like this: \n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\nNext, we have the HTML tag, which tells the browser that everything within it is an HTML document. We then have the two main sections of an HTML document: the head and the body. The head section contains information about the document, including the title, meta data, and links to external resources such as stylesheets. The body section contains the actual content of the document, including headings, paragraphs, images, and links. \n\nExample: \n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>My Webpage</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage!</h1>\n    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>\n    <img src=\"picture.jpg\" alt=\"An image\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Click me!</a>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nQuiz:\n1. What does the doctype declaration do?\n2. What are the two main sections of an HTML document?\n\nAnswers:\n1. The doctype declaration tells the browser what version of HTML we are using.\n2. The two main sections of an HTML document are the head and the body."

                    "info": "Lesson on HTML Tags and their Uses:\n\nIn HTML, tags are used to describe the structure and content of a webpage. They are surrounded by angle brackets and most tags come in pairs, like <p> and </p>, with the opening tag indicating the start of a section of content and the closing tag indicating the end of that section. Some tags, like <img>, are self-closing and do not require a closing tag.\n\nExamples of commonly used HTML tags are <h1>, <p>, and <ul>. The <h1> tag is used for headings, with the <h2> tag being used for subheadings, and so on. The <p> tag is used for paragraphs, while the <ul> tag denotes an unordered list and the <ol> tag denotes an ordered list.\n\nHTML tags also have attributes that modify their behavior or appearance. For example, the <a> tag is used to create hyperlinks, and the href attribute is used to specify the URL of the destination page. The <img> tag has attributes like src and alt, which specify the source image and alternative text, respectively.\n\nQuiz:\n1. Which HTML tag is used for headings?\n2. What attribute is used with the <a> tag to specify the URL of the destination page?\n\nAnswers:\n1. <h1>\n2. href"

The six levels of headings available in HTML include h1 through h6. The h1 tag creates the largest and most prominent heading, while h6 creates the smallest.\n\nTo create a heading in HTML, simply enclose the text you want to use as a heading within the appropriate h1 through h6 tags. For example, the code <h1>This is a heading!</h1> would create a large and prominent heading.\n\nParagraphs are used to organize text into blocks of content. To create a paragraph in HTML, simply enclose the desired text within the <p> and </p> tags. For example, <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p> would create a paragraph containing the text \"This is a paragraph of text.\"\n\nLists are used to organize content into ordered or unordered lists. To create an unordered list in HTML, use the <ul> and </ul> tags, and enclose each list item within <li> and </li> tags. For an ordered list, use the <ol> and </ol> tags instead.\n\nExample:\n```html\n<h1>This is a Heading</h1>\n<p>This is a paragraph containing text.</p>\n<h2>Another Heading</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>List item 1</li>\n  <li>List item 2</li>\n  <li>List item 3</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nQuiz:\n1. What is the largest heading available in HTML?\n2. How do you create a paragraph in HTML?\n3. What tags are used to create an ordered list in HTML?\n\nAnswers:\n1. h1\n2. Enclose text within the <p> and </p> tags\n3. <ol> and </ol>"

                    "info": "Lesson Content:\nIn HTML, you can add hyperlinks and images to your web pages, which can provide additional information for your users and enhance the overall user experience. To add a hyperlink to your HTML document, you will use the a tag with the href attribute. The href attribute specifies the URL of the web page you want to link to. For example, the following code will create a hyperlink to the Google website:\n\n`<a href=\"http://www.google.com\">Click here to visit Google</a>`\n\nSimilarly, to add an image to your HTML document, you will use the img tag with the src attribute. The src attribute specifies the path to the image file. For example, the following code will display an image named \"example.jpg\" located in the same directory as your HTML file:\n\n`<img src=\"example.jpg\" alt=\"An example image\">`\n\nRemember to also include the alt attribute for every image on your webpage, as it provides an alternative text description for the image if it can't be displayed.\n\nPractice problem: \nCreate a hyperlink to the Wikipedia page about HTML on your webpage. Also, add the image \"example.png\" to your webpage.\n\nSolution:\n`<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML\">Learn more about HTML on Wikipedia</a>`\n\n`<img src=\"example.png\" alt=\"An example image\">`\n\nSummary:\nHyperlinks and images are essential elements in web development. In this lesson, we learned how to add hyperlinks and images to an HTML document using the a and img tags respectively. Remember to include the necessary attributes to optimize the user experience."

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a web design language used to style HTML documents. With CSS, you can change the look and feel of your website, adding colors, fonts, and layout designs.\n\nTo apply CSS to an HTML document, you must first establish a link between them, usually by adding a link element in the head section of your HTML file. Once you’ve linked the files, you can begin styling the HTML elements.\n\nAn example of a CSS style is changing the background color of an HTML body. By using the following CSS code, we can set the background color to red:\n\nbody {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n\nTo apply these styles to HTML elements, you can use different selectors, such as ID selectors, class selectors, and element selectors, among others.\n\nPractice problem: Create a new HTML document and apply CSS styles to change the font size and color of your headings to match your preferred style.\n\nSolution: To change the font size and color of your headings, you can use CSS code like this:\n\nh1 {\n  font-size: 36px;\n  color: blue;\n}\n\nh2 {\n  font-size: 24px;\n  color: green;\n}\n\nSummary: In this lesson, we learned about basic CSS styling for HTML elements. We explored how to apply CSS to an HTML document, how to add selectors, and how to modify the appearance of HTML elements using CSS."

These tags are important because they help your readers to understand the hierarchy of your content, with <h1> being the most important and <h6> being the least important.\n\nAnother commonly used tag is the <p> tag, which is used to create paragraphs. By enclosing your text in this tag, you are telling the browser that this text should be displayed in its own separate paragraph.\n\nFinally, we have the <ul> and <ol> tags, which are used to create unordered and ordered lists respectively.

Comments are non-executable lines of code that are used to explain sections of code or to leave notes for yourself or other developers who may read the code in the future. To add a comment in an HTML file, you can use the <!-- and --> tags surrounding the text you want to comment out.\n\nFor example, if you have a div element that you want to temporarily remove from your code, you can add a comment around it like this:\n\n<!-- <div>\n  This is some content inside the div.\n</div> -->\n\nTo re-enable the element, simply remove the opening and closing comment tags. Comments can also be useful when working with a team of developers, allowing you to communicate any changes or notes about the code.\n\nQuiz:\n1. What are comments in HTML used for?\n2.
