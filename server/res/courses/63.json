When using a microwave, it is important to use a container that is safe for microwave use to avoid any dangers or accidents. Look for containers that are labeled \"microwave-safe\" or have symbols indicating they are safe to use in the microwave. Avoid containers made of metal, as they can cause sparks or fires, and containers made of certain types of plastic, such as polystyrene, which can melt or release harmful chemicals.\n\nFor Example, glass, ceramic, and microwave-safe plastics such as polypropylene, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and PETE are safe to use in the microwave. Make sure to check the label or symbol on the container before use. By using the right container, we not only ensure our safety but also prevent harmful chemicals getting into our food.\n\nQuiz:\n1. What kind of containers should be avoided in the microwave?\n2. What are some of the safe materials to use in the microwave?\n3. Why is it important to use the right container in the microwave?\n\nAnswers:\n1. Containers made of metal and certain types of plastic should be avoided in the microwave.\n2.

Microwave power is measured in watts, and it is important to choose the correct power settings when cooking Apples. Most microwaves have several power settings ranging from 10% to 100%. Lower power settings are best for cooking Apples, as they allow for a more uniform cooking process.\n\nCooking times for Apples in the microwave will vary depending on their size and type. Small Apples may only require 1-2 minutes on a low power setting, while larger Apples may require up to 5 minutes on a low power setting. As a general rule of thumb, it is better to microwave Apples in short intervals, stopping the microwave to check their progress frequently.\n\nAn excellent resource when determining the correct microwave power setting and cooking time is the USDA guidelines, which provide specific cooking instructions for different types of food.\n\nQuiz:\n1.
