HTML is made up of different tags, which are used to format and structure text and other content on a web page. \n\nSome common HTML tags that you will encounter include the opening tag \"<h1>\" and closing tag \"</h1>\" which is used to indicate the main heading of a web page. Another commonly used tag is the \"<p>\" and closing tag \"</p>\", which is used to indicate paragraphs. \n\nAn example of how HTML works is if you wanted to create a web page with a heading and a paragraph of text, you would write the following code: \n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n\t<title>My Web Page</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\t<h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>\n\t<p>This is an example of a paragraph on my web page.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\nIn the above code, the \"<!DOCTYPE html>\" tag at the top indicates that this is an HTML document. The \"<head>\" and \"</head>\" tags are used to provide information about the web page such as the title of the page and any links to external files. Lastly, the \"<body>\" and \"</body>\" tags are used to indicate the content of the web page that will be displayed to the user.\n\nQuiz:\n1. What does HTML stand for?\n2.

Text formatting and styling can be an essential part of any design, and understanding how to use HTML to achieve these effects is essential for creating professional-looking web pages. We will cover topics such as changing font types and colors, aligning text, and creating headings and subheadings.\n\nOne of the most useful text formatting features in HTML is the ability to change font types and colors. By using the font tag, you can set a specific font for your text and change its color. For example, you can use the following code snippet to set the font of a paragraph to Arial and change its color to red:\n\n<font face=\"Arial\" color=\"red\">This text will be Arial and red color</font>\n\nAnother useful HTML tag for text formatting is the align attribute. This tag can be used to change the alignment of your text within a particular element. For example, you can use the following code snippet to center align a paragraph:\n\n<p align=\"center\">This paragraph will be center-aligned</p>\n\nFinally, creating headings and subheadings can be done using the H1 to H6 tags. These tags allow you to create different levels of headings and subheadings, with H1 being the largest and H6 the smallest. For example, you can use the following code snippet to create an H1 heading:\n\n<h1>This is a Heading Level 1</h1>\n\nOverall, understanding how to format text using HTML is an essential skill for anyone looking to create professional-looking websites. By using the font, align, and heading tags, you can create visually appealing pages with ease.\n\nQuiz:\n1. What is the HTML tag to change the color of text? \n2. How can you center-align a paragraph in HTML?\n3. Which tag is used to create subheadings?\nAnswers:\n1. The HTML tag to change the color of text is the font tag.\n2.

These allow us to control the behavior and appearance of HTML elements more precisely. Some examples of advanced tags include <iframe>, which allows us to embed external content such as videos or maps into our pages, and <canvas>, which lets us create interactive animations.\n\nLet's take a look at an example of using an advanced HTML tag. The <meta> tag is commonly used to provide information about a web page to search engines and browsers. Here's an example code snippet for the <meta> tag:\n\n```<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"description\" content=\"This is an example of a meta description\">\n  <meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"HTML, CSS, JavaScript\">\n  <title>My Web Page</title>\n</head>\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, we're specifying the character encoding, a description of the page, and some keywords that relate to the content of the page. These elements help search engines properly index and display our page.\n\nNow, let's put our knowledge to the test with a practice problem:\n```Create an <audio> element that plays a song from an external source.```\nTo do this, we need to use the <audio> tag and specify the URL of the source file using the \"src\" attribute. Here's an example code snippet:\n\n```<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"http://example.com/mysong.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n</audio>\n```\n\nThe \"controls\" attribute adds a built-in audio player to our web page so the user can interact with the audio file.\n\nIn summary, advanced HTML tags and attributes give us more control over the appearance and behavior of our web pages, allowing us to create richer and more dynamic content."

Forms are essential in gathering information from users on a website. An HTML form can contain various types of input fields such as text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, drop-down lists, and more.\n\nTo create a form, we must use the `<form>` tag in HTML. The `action` attribute specifies where to send the form data when the user submits it. The `method` attribute specifies the HTTP method used to send the form-data. There are two methods, GET and POST. The `input` tag is used for setting up different types of fields within the form such as text fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons. The `label` tag is used to define a label for different input fields.\n\nHere is an example of a simple form that asks for a user's name and email address:\n\n```\n<form action=\"submit-form.php\" method=\"POST\">\n  <label for=\"name\">Name:</label>\n  <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"user_name\"><br><br>\n  <label for=\"email\">Email:</label>\n  <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"user_email\"><br><br>\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n</form>\n```\nIn this example, we create a form with two fields, one for the user's name and one for their email address. The `type` attribute of the `<input>` tag specifies the type of field expected, and the `id` and `name` attributes are used for identifying each input field. The `submit` button is used to send the form data to the server once the user fills in the required information.\n\nQuiz:\n1. What is the purpose of using a `form` tag in HTML?\n2. Name one type of input field that can be used in a form.\n\nAnswers:\n1. The `form` tag is used to establish a form element on a webpage that can collect data from users.\n2.

HTML5 provides several attributes to help us in validating form data, such as `required`, `pattern`, `min`, `max`, and `maxlength`. The `required` attribute specifies that a form field must be filled out, and will prevent form submission until it is satisfied. The `pattern` attribute can be used to specify a regex pattern that the input value must match. The `min`, `max`, and `maxlength` attributes can be used to specify the minimum and maximum length or value of an input. \n\nFor example, let's say we have a form that requires users to enter their phone numbers. We can use the `pattern` attribute to ensure that users submit phone numbers in a valid format, such as `123-456-7890`. The `pattern` attribute would be written as follows: `<input type=\"text\" pattern=\"[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}\" required>`. This would only allow form submission if the phone number is entered in the correct format, and will display an error message if it is not.\n\nPractice problem: Create a form that asks the user to enter a password between 8 and 20 characters in length, with at least one uppercase letter and one number. \n\nSolution: `<input type=\"password\" pattern=\"^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9]).{8,20}$\" required>`\n\nSummary: In this lesson, we learned that HTML5 provides several attributes that can be used to validate form data, including `required`, `pattern`, `min`, `max`, and `maxlength`.

This not only improves the user experience but also helps in SEO, as Google prefers websites that are mobile-friendly.\n3. An example of responsive design can be seen in Netflix's website. Whether you're browsing on a desktop or a mobile device, the website adjusts dynamically to provide the best viewing experience possible. As a result, users can easily access and stream their favorite movies and TV shows, regardless of the device they are using."

                    "info": "Using CSS media queries to create responsive layout:\n\nIn this lesson, we will be learning about using CSS media queries to create responsive layout. Media queries are a powerful tool that allow us to write different styles for different devices. With media queries, we can specify different styles for screens of different sizes, orientations, and resolutions. This makes our website more accessible and user-friendly on any device.\n\nAn example of media queries in practice would be this:\n```\n@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {\n  body {\n    font-size: 14px;\n  }\n}\n```\nThis CSS code sets the font size of the body to 14px only when the screen size is smaller than 600px. This is just one example of how media queries can be used to enhance the user experience.\n\nQuiz:\n1. What are media queries used for?\n2. Can media queries be used to set different styles for different device orientations?\n3. Give an example of a media query in practice.\n\nAnswers:\n1. Media queries are used to write different styles for different devices based on screen size, orientation, and resolution.\n2. Yes, media queries can be used to set different styles for portrait and landscape orientation.\n3. ```\n@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) {\n  /* Styles go here */\n}\n```"

                    "info": "Creating fluid and flexible grid layouts:\n\nIn a responsive design, grids help organize content and make it easier to view and read. A fluid grid layout allows content to adjust dynamically based on screen size, rather than a fixed grid layout which always stays the same size. With fluid grids, content scales up or down proportionally, allowing for a better user experience across all devices.\n\nLet's take a look at an example of a fluid grid layout. [Include an image link to a website with a fluid grid layout.]\n\nNow let's practice creating your own fluid grid layout. [Include a sample problem, such as designing a webpage that includes a header, main content area, and footer with a fluid 3-column layout. Provide a solution to the practice problem in the next paragraph. ]\n\nPractice problem solution:\nTo create a fluid 3-column layout, the HTML code would include a container div with a fixed width, and 3 child divs that each have a fluid width of 33.33%, with a float:left property. The CSS code would include media queries for different screen sizes to adjust the layout accordingly.\n\nIn summary, fluid grid layouts are an essential part of responsive web design and allow for a dynamic user experience. With practice and proper use of CSS, designers can create professional-looking, responsive web layouts."
