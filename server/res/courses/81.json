Vectors are used to represent quantities that have both a magnitude (number) and a direction. In other words, a vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude and direction, unlike a scalar that only has magnitude. \n\nVectors are represented by an arrow, starting from an initial point and ending at a terminal point. It's important to note that vectors can exist in any dimension, but we will be focusing on two and three-dimensional vectors.\n\nOne important concept in vectors is the zero vector, which has a magnitude of 0, and no direction. Another important concept is the unit vector, which has a magnitude of 1, and points in a specified direction. Unit vectors are frequently used to express vectors in a particular direction.\n\nAn example of a vector could be a force acting on an object in a given direction. Think of a force acting on a block moving up a plane. It's important to note that vectors can also be added or subtracted from each other, which we will discuss in more detail in later lessons.\n\nQuiz:\n1. What is a vector?\n2.

Vector multiplication is a key concept in linear algebra as it allows us to perform important operations such as scaling, rotating, and transforming vectors. \n\nTo start, we need to understand the two types of vector multiplication: scalar multiplication and dot product multiplication. Scalar multiplication involves multiplying a vector by a scalar, which is simply a number. This operation rescales the vector by the specified amount. Dot product multiplication involves multiplying two vectors, and it produces a scalar result. \n\nTo multiply two vectors using the dot product, we first need to calculate the product of their individual components and then add these products together to get the final scalar result. An example of vector multiplication is finding the projection of one vector onto another vector. \n\nImagine we have two vectors, A and B. We want to find the projection of A onto B. We can accomplish this using vector multiplication. First, we need to calculate the dot product of A and B, which gives us a scalar. Then, we divide this dot product by the magnitude of B, which gives us the projection of A onto B. \n\nTo summarize, vector multiplication is a key concept in linear algebra.

Through this lesson, you will learn how to translate the system of equations into an Augmented Matrix, use elementary row operations to reduce the matrix into a row echelon form, and then solve the system of equations.\n\nExplanation: Gaussian Elimination is an effective and widely used technique for solving systems of linear equations. To begin the process, we first need to create an augmented matrix, which is essentially the matrix form of the system of equations. Once we have done so, the next step is to use elementary row operations – swapping rows, multiplying rows, adding rows – to create a matrix that is in a row echelon form. This means that the entries below the main diagonal are zero. We then use back substitution to solve the system of equations from the simplified matrix.\n\nExample: Given the following system of linear equations:\n3x + 2y - z = 5\n2x - 2y + 4z = -2\n-x + 1/2y -z = 0\n\nWe can first create the augmented matrix:\n\n| 3  2 -1 | 5 |\n| 2 -2  4 | -2|\n|-1 1/2 -1| 0 |\n\nThen, using elementary row operations, we can simplify the matrix to row echelon form:\n\n| 3  2 -1 | 5 |\n| 0 -4  6 | -16 |\n|0 0 0 | 2|\n\nFrom here, we can easily solve the system of equations:\n3x + 2y - z = 5     (equation 1)\n-4y + 6z = -16      (equation 2)\n0 = 2               (equation 3)\n\nSince equation 3 is a contradiction, we can determine that the system of equations has no solution.\n\nScenario: Imagine you are a civil engineer tasked with designing the electrical circuit for a new building. You have a system of three equations that relates to the circuit, but you don't know how to solve it. Use Gaussian Elimination to solve the system of equations.\n\nAction: Write down the system of equations that you have been given, and then create the augmented matrix. Use elementary row operations to simplify the matrix to a row echelon form, and then use back substitution to solve the equation.\n\nSummary: Gaussian Elimination is a powerful method for solving systems of linear equations. We can begin by creating an augmented matrix, then use elementary row operations to simplify the matrix. Once we have simplified the matrix to row echelon form, we can solve the system of equations using back substitution."

Gaussian elimination is a method used to solve systems of linear equations by reducing the system to its row echelon form through elementary row operations. Pivoting is a strategy that is used to reduce the computational errors that may occur during the elimination process.\n\nPivoting is the process of swapping rows in a system of linear equations to prevent dividing by a small number. There are two types of pivoting strategies: partial pivoting and complete pivoting. In partial pivoting, the largest element in a column is selected as the pivot and used to eliminate the other elements in the column. In complete pivoting, the largest element in the entire matrix is selected as the pivot and used to eliminate the other elements in the matrix.\n\nPartial pivoting can be done by using the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the largest element in the column beneath the current pivot element.\n2. Swap the current row with the row containing the largest element.\n3. Use the new pivot element to eliminate the other elements in the column.\n\nComplete pivoting is similar to partial pivoting but involves searching the entire matrix for the largest element.

In this lesson, we will explore several examples of real-life scenarios where systems of linear equations come into play.\n\nExplanation:\nWe will start by defining what we mean by systems of linear equations and understanding how they work. Then, we will dive into several examples of scenarios where these types of equations are used, such as calculating profit in a business, determining the optimal way to invest money, and deciding how much to charge for a product or service.\n\nMore In-Depth Info on Topic:\nWe will also discuss how systems of linear equations can be used to represent real-world situations graphically and examine some cases where this type of visualization can be particularly useful. We will learn how to solve systems of linear equations using different methods, such as Gaussian elimination and using matrices.\n\nExample of Topic:\nOne example to illustrate this concept is through the use of a word problem for finding the break-even point of a business. A break-even point is the point where a business neither makes a profit nor incurs a loss. In this example, we will explore how to use systems of linear equations to calculate the break-even point.\n\nScenario:\nSuppose you decided to start a clothing business. To break even, you must make enough profit to cover your fixed costs, such as rent, equipment, salaries, and the cost of goods sold (COGS). Assume your fixed cost is $20,000, your COGS is $15 per unit, and you sell each unit for $25. Using systems of linear equations, how many units would you have to sell to break even?\n\nAction for Scenario:\nTo solve this problem using systems of linear equations, we can set up an equation where the total revenue is equal to the total cost. Total revenue is equal to the number of units sold multiplied by the sale price per unit, while total cost is equal to the fixed cost plus the variable cost per unit. Thus, if we let x be the number of units sold, our equation is:\n\n25x = 20,000 + 15x\n\nSimplifying the expression, we can solve for x:\n\n10x = 20,000\n\nx = 2,000\n\nSo the break-even point for the business is 2,000 units. If the business sells less than 2,000 units, it will incur a loss, and if it sells more than 2,000 units, it will make a profit.\n\nSummary of the Lesson:\nIn summary, systems of linear equations have a wide range of applications in real-life situations. When faced with a problem, we can use systems of linear equations to model it and solve for the unknowns. Through this lesson, we've learned the basics of systems of linear equations and how to apply them to various scenarios.\n\nQuiz:\n1. What is the break-even point of a business?\n2. How can systems of linear equations be represented graphically?\n3. What are some real-world examples where systems of linear equations come into play?\n\nAnswers:\n1. The break-even point is the point where a business neither makes a profit nor incurs a loss.\n2. Systems of linear equations can be represented graphically by using lines to represent the equations and the point(s) of intersection as the solution.\n3. Some examples of where systems of linear equations come into play include calculating profit in a business, determining the optimal way to invest money, and deciding how much to charge for a product or service."
