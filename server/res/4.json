One key objective of requirements engineering is to establish a clear understanding of the customer\u2019s needs and expectations, which are then translated into actionable software requirements. This process involves close collaboration between stakeholders, business analysts, software engineers, and quality assurance professionals to ensure that the system meets the needs of the end-users.\n\nOne important aspect of requirements engineering is identifying the various types of requirements. These can be broadly categorized as functional and non-functional requirements. Functional requirements define what the software should do, while non-functional requirements define how well it should do it. Some examples of non-functional requirements include performance, usability, scalability, reliability, maintainability, and security.\n\nQuestions with Answers:\n\nQ: What is the objective of requirements engineering?\nA: The main objective of requirements engineering is to establish a clear understanding of the customer\u2019s needs and expectations, which are then translated into actionable software requirements.\n\nQ: What are the different types of requirements?\nA: The two main types of requirements are functional and non-functional requirements. Functional requirements define what the software should do, while non-functional requirements define how well it should do it."

It involves creating a blueprint for software development that functions as a guide for developers throughout the project. The process considers various factors, such as reliability, performance, maintainability, and security. \n\nSoftware design involves transforming the requirements of a customer or client into a technical specification that can be implemented by software developers. A good software design is crucial for creating software that is efficient, reliable, and easy to maintain. It should also be flexible enough to accommodate changes in requirements or new functionality. Ultimately, a successful software system requires a solid design that considers all relevant factors and meets both the customer's and end-users' needs.\n\nQuiz Question: What is the goal of software design?\n\nAnswer: The goal of software design is to create a blueprint for software development that functions as a guide for developers throughout the project.

They are closely related to the structure of your code and play a big role in the long-term maintainability and scalability of your application. In this lesson, we'll explore some of the most commonly used software architecture patterns.\n\nOne of the most popular patterns is the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. MVC separates the application into three parts: the model (data and business logic), the view (user interface), and the controller (manages interactions). This separation provides clear boundaries between different parts of the application, making it easy to develop, test, and maintain the codebase.\n\nAnother popular pattern is the Microservices architecture. In this pattern, you break down your application into small, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each service handles a specific business task and communicates with others through APIs. Microservices follows the single responsibility principle, where each service is responsible for solving a specific problem, making it easier to scale up and maintain the application. \n\nQuiz:\n1. What is the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture? \nAnswer: MVC separates the application into three parts: the model (data and business logic), the view (user interface), and the controller (manages interactions).\n\n2. What is the aim of Microservices Architecture?\nAnswer: Microservices architecture breaks down the application into small, independent, and loosely coupled services to handle specific business tasks to make it easier to scale up and maintain the application."

It allows you to create diagrams that represent a system or process graphically. UML diagrams help in visualizing the design as well as identify any possible flaws and gaps.\n\n2. Wireframes:\nWireframes are simple, black and white diagrams that represent features and content. They show the basic layout of a page or screen and are used to finalize the look and feel of the software before it is built.\n\n3. Prototype:\nA prototype is an initial model of the final product which helps designers to test the software and correct any errors. It is a functional model of the software without the final coding, giving real-life usability feedback of the software.\n\nQuestions and Answers: \n\n1.

In this lesson, we will explore some of the most common design patterns used in software engineering.\n\nCreational patterns focus on the process of object creation. They are used to abstract the process of object creation and are useful when the object creation process is complex. Structural patterns focus on organizing classes and objects in a structure that is easy to understand and maintain. Finally, Behavioral patterns focus on the interactions between objects, providing patterns for communication between objects.\n\nSome common design patterns that we will explore include: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Adapter, Composite, and Observer. By the end of this lesson, you should be able to identify these design patterns and when to use them in your own software design."
