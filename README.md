## To Run
This uses [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en), so you will need to install it.

When pulled, run `npm install` in the `/` folder to install the required modules

Then `cd server`, and run `node api.js 3000` to start the API on port 3000 (This is hard coded so don't change it).

In another terminal, `cd client`, and run `node web.js 80` to start the client server on port 80 (You may need to use something above 1024 if you have permission issues).

You can then access the site on [http://localhost](http://localhost)
